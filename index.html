    <p>This is Reginald the Dino. He is a herbivore and has a playful personality. Up to date on all of his shots and requires little training. A perfect starter pet!</p>
    <img src="img/dino-2.jpg">
    <p>This is Rex. He is an older dinosaur and requires some extra love and attention! Great with kids, keep babies and other small pets away [he can be grumpy :(]</p>
    <img src="img/dino-3.gif">
    <p>This is Octavia. She is carnivorous; not a good starter dino for the inexperienced. Great with kids, though.</p>
    <img src="img/dino-4.jpg">
    <p>This is Animal. A newborn requiring full house/yard training. Can be trained on a vegetarian diet if it includes Beyond or Impossible 'meat'.</p>

    <p>This is Speed Racer. Requires a large aquatic environment (minimum 10000 gallons) with plenty of stimulation! Watch them swim laps all day!</p>
